# Adding GUI to Ubuntu Server

To implement a graphical user interface (GUI) on an Ubuntu server, follow these simplified steps:

1. Open the terminal on your Ubuntu server.

2. Install TaskSel, a tool for installing multiple related packages as a coordinated task:
```bash
sudo apt install tasksel
```

3. Use TaskSel to install the Ubuntu desktop environment:
```bash
sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop
```

4. Alternatively, you can directly install the Ubuntu desktop packages using:
```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop^
```

5. Once the installation is complete, reboot your server to apply the changes:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

We have successfully integrated a graphical interface into our Ubuntu server environment, enhancing its usability and accessibility.
